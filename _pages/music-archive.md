Music that I listen to, and want to share with you!  
You'll find everything here, and I listen to a wide variety of music.

Music is special to me. <br /><br /> It invokes emotions that are sometimes buried deep inside my mind, and allows me to escape the daily nuances of life. It brings meaning to situations where words can't. <br /><br /> It also helps me to get lost in code whenever I am programming, and makes me focus an insane amount :100:
