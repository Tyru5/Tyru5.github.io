# :thinking: :bulb: :exclamation:
This was my first Chrome extension that I have ever implemented and released. It was such an awesome process, and I learned
an insane amount! For instance, I learned how to work with and incorporate Chrome's ```runtime``` API, and create the 
final bundle to upload to the Chrome webstore -- all of which would be expanded on later! 

For a while now, it has been a goal of mine to create an extension for the browser 
( whether that be Chrome, FireFox, MS Edge, etc... ) and I finally did it! Feels great -- and I'm excited to share what 
I learned, and some aspects of the process with you.

# But why Ti...why?
Because why not??

haha kidding :sweat_smile:

As stated earlier, it was always a goal of mine to create and implement an extension for the browser. I also wanted to
challenge myself and work with something I haven't worked with before. I also love learning, and I learned a lot from
this project.

Lastly -- If I am able to affect a single individual with this plugin, then that's a win in my book.

## What I wanted to accomplish with this project
More to come here.

## This project's future, what do I want to add to it?

# About The Project
Have you ever wanted to navigate Amazon's customer review images by using the keyboard? Well look no further,
now you can! 

This was an **annoyance** of mine, and thus my full motivation for implementing this chrome extension. Okay, I wouldn't say
**full** motivation haha however it was a huge contributing factor, for sure!

At the end of the day I wanted to implement a simple solution, to a daily occurrence / observation of mine.

This Chrome extention, allows you to navigate Amazon's customer review images in a more intuitive, seamless manner. 
It allows you to use the left and right arrows on your keyboard as well as allowing you
to close the image pop-up modal by hitting the Escape key.

Below, are a few images showcasing how the extension looks once you have installed it!
