# :thinking: :bulb: :exclamation:

This was my first Chrome extension that I have ever implemented and released. It was such an awesome process, and I learned
an insane amount! For instance, I learned how to work with and incorporate Chrome's ```runtime``` API, and create the
final bundle to upload to the Chrome webstore.

For a while now, it has been a goal of mine to create an extension for the browser
( whether that be Chrome, FireFox, MS Edge, etc... ) and I finally did it! Feels great -- and I'm excited to share what
I learned, and some aspects of the process with you.

# But why Ti...why?

Because why not??

haha kidding :sweat_smile:

As stated earlier, it was always a goal of mine to create and implement an extension for the browser. I also wanted to
challenge myself and work with something I haven't worked with before. I also love learning, and I learned a lot from
this project.

Lastly -- If I am able to affect a single individual with this plugin, then that's a win in my book.

## What I wanted to accomplish with this project

I  had two goals in mind when I initially started this project.

- First and foremost -- learn something new and challenge myself! :rocket:
- Create a Chrome extension that would benefit the user who is using it. Create a solution to an observation.

## This project's future, what do I want to add to it?

Great question -- and a question that I have thought about quite a bit! I would love to further expand on the extensions' functionality
and also improve some of it's UI/UX.

### Some :bulb:'s I have so far

- Create a new UI/view that would house the amazon product image(s) that the user saved. So essentially a collection view. This could serve as a quick reference to a product that a user found interesting on amazon rather than looking through their bookmarks or searching for the product again on amazon.
- Add a review / rating feature for the extension for the user to provide feeback and constructive criticism!
- Redesign the main popup view UI to be more intuitive and easier to manage, especially if I am going to be creating a new collection view for the images.

# About The Project

Have you ever wanted to navigate Amazon's customer review images by using the keyboard? Well look no further,
now you can! (end cheesy infomercial here :sweat_smile:)

This was an annoyance of mine, and thus my full motivation for implementing this chrome extension. Okay, I wouldn't say
full motivation haha however it was a huge contributing factor, for sure!

At the end of the day I wanted to implement a simple solution, to a daily occurrence / observation of mine.

This Chrome extention, allows you to navigate Amazon's customer review images in a more intuitive, seamless manner.
It allows you to use the left and right arrows on your keyboard as well as allowing you
to close the image pop-up modal by hitting the Escape key.

Below, are a few images showcasing how the extension looks once you have installed it!

This Chrome extension was built with the following libraries and tools :

- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) -- Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler
- [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) -- the complete tooltip, popover, dropdown, and menu solution for the web
