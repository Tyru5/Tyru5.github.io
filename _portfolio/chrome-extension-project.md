# About The Project
Have you ever wanted to navigate Amazon's customer review images by using the keyboard? Well look no further,
now you can! 

This was an annoyance of mine, and thus my full motivation for implementing this chrome extension. 
ðŸ˜… Just a simple solution, to a daily occurrence / observation of mine. 

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to navigate Amazon's customer review images in a more
intuitive, seamless manner. It allows you to use the left and right arrows on your keyboard as well as allowing you
to close the image pop-up modal by hitting the Escape key.

This chrome extension was built with the following libraries and tools :
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [iziToast](https://izitoast.marcelodolza.com/)

* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
